# Football Player Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project, managed by Dr. Nada Sharaf and Dr. Ali Salem, explores the performance of football players based on data analysis. The dataset used for the analysis was obtained from Kaggle at [Player Scores Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores/data).

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to investigate various aspects of football player performance, including goals, assists, yellow cards, red cards, and minutes played. The project is conducted as part of the Data Engineering and Visualization course during the Winter Semester of 2023 at the German International University, Faculty of Informatics and Computer Science.

## Milestone 2 Summary

In Milestone 2, the focus was on data integration and analysis. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes information on competitions, games, clubs, players, and player appearances. The integration process resulted in a new dataset, and analysis was conducted to answer specific research questions.

### Data Integration

The dataset integration involved merging information from different CSV files, including Competitions.csv, Games.csv, Clubs.csv, Players.csv, and Appearances.csv. The analysis considered variables such as goals, assists, yellow cards, red cards, and minutes played.

### Analysis

Visualizations and statistical analyses were performed to answer research questions related to player performance. Notable insights included the correlation between minutes played and the frequency of yellow and red cards. Additionally, a concentration of red card incidents was observed between 45 and 60 minutes.
